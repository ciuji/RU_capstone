1 NOW THE SERPENT WAS MORE SUBTIL THAN ANY BEAST OF THE FIELD WHICH THE LORD GOD HAD MADE  AND HE SAID UNTO THE WOMAN  YEA  HATH GOD SAID  YE SHALL NOT EAT OF EVERY TREE OF THE GARDEN 
2 AND THE WOMAN SAID UNTO THE SERPENT  WE MAY EAT OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES OF THE GARDEN 
3 BUT OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREE WHICH IS IN THE MIDST OF THE GARDEN  GOD HATH SAID  YE SHALL NOT EAT OF IT  NEITHER SHALL YE TOUCH IT  LEST YE DIE 
4 AND THE SERPENT SAID UNTO THE WOMAN  YE SHALL NOT SURELY DIE 
5 FOR GOD DOTH KNOW THAT IN THE DAY YE EAT THEREOF  THEN YOUR EYES SHALL BE OPENED  AND YE SHALL BE AS GODS  KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL 
6 AND WHEN THE WOMAN SAW THAT THE TREE WAS GOOD FOR FOOD  AND THAT IT WAS PLEASANT TO THE EYES  AND A TREE TO BE DESIRED TO MAKE ONE WISE  SHE TOOK OF THE FRUIT THEREOF  AND DID EAT  AND GAVE ALSO UNTO HER HUSBAND WITH HER  AND HE DID EAT 
7 AND THE EYES OF THEM BOTH WERE OPENED  AND THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE NAKED  AND THEY SEWED FIG LEAVES TOGETHER  AND MADE THEMSELVES APRONS 
8 AND THEY HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LORD GOD WALKING IN THE GARDEN IN THE COOL OF THE DAY  AND ADAM AND HIS WIFE HID THEMSELVES FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD GOD AMONGST THE TREES OF THE GARDEN 
9 AND THE LORD GOD CALLED UNTO ADAM  AND SAID UNTO HIM  WHERE ART THOU

11 AND HE SAID  WHO TOLD THEE THAT THOU WAST NAKED  HAST THOU EATEN OF THE TREE  WHEREOF I COMMANDED THEE THAT THOU SHOULDEST NOT EAT 
12 AND THE MAN SAID  THE WOMAN WHOM THOU GAVEST TO BE WITH ME  SHE GAVE ME OF THE TREE  AND I DID EAT 
13 AND THE LORD GOD SAID UNTO THE WOMAN  WHAT IS THIS THAT THOU HAST DONE  AND THE WOMAN SAID  THE SERPENT BEGUILED ME  AND I DID EAT 
14 AND THE LORD GOD SAID UNTO THE SERPENT  BECAUSE THOU HAST DONE THIS  THOU ART CURSED ABOVE ALL CATTLE  AND ABOVE EVERY BEAST OF THE FIELD  UPON THY BELLY SHALT THOU GO  AND DUST SHALT THOU EAT ALL THE DAYS OF THY LIFE 
15 AND I WILL PUT ENMITY BETWEEN THEE AND THE WOMAN  AND BETWEEN THY SEED AND HER SEED  IT SHALL BRUISE THY HEAD  AND THOU SHALT BRUISE HIS HEEL 
16 UNTO THE WOMAN HE SAID  I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY THY SORROW AND THY CONCEPTION  IN SORROW THOU SHALT BRING FORTH CHILDREN  AND THY DESIRE SHALL BE TO THY HUSBAND  AND HE SHALL RULE OVER THEE 
17 AND UNTO ADAM HE SAID  BECAUSE THOU HAST HEARKENED UNTO THE VOICE OF THY WIFE  AND HAST EATEN OF THE TREE  OF WHICH I COMMANDED THEE  SAYING  THOU SHALT NOT EAT OF IT  CURSED IS THE GROUND FOR THY SAKE  IN SORROW SHALT THOU EAT OF IT ALL THE DAYS OF THY LIFE 
18 THORNS ALSO AND THISTLES SHALL IT BRING FORTH TO THEE  AND THOU SHALT EAT THE HERB OF THE FIELD 
19 IN THE SWEAT OF THY FACE SHALT THOU EAT BREAD  TILL THOU RETURN UNTO THE GROUND  FOR OUT OF IT WAST THOU TAKEN  FOR DUST THOU ART  AND UNTO DUST SHALT THOU RETURN 
20 AND ADAM CALLED HIS WIFE S NAME EVE  BECAUSE SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF ALL LIVING 
21 UNTO ADAM ALSO AND TO HIS WIFE DID THE LORD GOD MAKE COATS OF SKINS  AND CLOTHED THEM 
22 AND THE LORD GOD SAID  BEHOLD  THE MAN IS BECOME AS ONE OF US  TO KNOW GOOD AND EVIL  AND NOW  LEST HE PUT FORTH HIS HAND  AND TAKE ALSO OF THE TREE OF LIFE  AND EAT  AND LIVE FOR EVER 
23 THEREFORE THE LORD GOD SENT HIM FORTH FROM THE GARDEN OF EDEN  TO TILL THE GROUND FROM WHENCE HE WAS TAKEN 
24 SO HE DROVE OUT THE MAN  AND HE PLACED AT THE EAST OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN CHERUBIMS  AND A FLAMING SWORD WHICH TURNED EVERY WAY  TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE TREE OF LIFE
