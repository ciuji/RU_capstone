CHAPTER 2 
1 THUS THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WERE FINISHED  AND ALL THE HOST OF THEM 
2 AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY GOD ENDED HIS WORK WHICH HE HAD MADE  AND HE RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORK WHICH HE HAD MADE 
3 AND GOD BLESSED THE SEVENTH DAY  AND SANCTIFIED IT  BECAUSE THAT IN IT HE HAD RESTED FROM ALL HIS WORK WHICH GOD CREATED AND MADE 
4 THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND OF THE EARTH WHEN THEY WERE CREATED  IN THE DAY THAT THE LORD GOD MADE THE EARTH AND THE HEAVENS 
5 AND EVERY PLANT OF THE FIELD BEFORE IT WAS IN THE EARTH  AND EVERY HERB OF THE FIELD BEFORE IT GREW  FOR THE LORD GOD HAD NOT CAUSED IT TO RAIN UPON THE EARTH  AND THERE WAS NOT A MAN TO TILL THE GROUND 
6 BUT THERE WENT UP A MIST FROM THE EARTH  AND WATERED THE WHOLE FACE OF THE GROUND 
7 AND THE LORD GOD FORMED MAN OF THE DUST OF THE GROUND  AND BREATHED INTO HIS NOSTRILS THE BREATH OF LIFE  AND MAN BECAME A LIVING SOUL 
8 AND THE LORD GOD PLANTED A GARDEN EASTWARD IN EDEN  AND THERE HE PUT THE MAN WHOM HE HAD FORMED 
9 AND OUT OF THE GROUND MADE THE LORD GOD TO GROW EVERY TREE THAT IS PLEASANT TO THE SIGHT  AND GOOD FOR FOOD  THE TREE OF LIFE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF THE GARDEN  AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL 
10 AND A RIVER WENT OUT OF EDEN TO WATER THE GARDEN  AND FROM THENCE IT WAS PARTED  AND BECAME INTO FOUR HEADS 
11 THE NAME OF THE FIRST IS PISON  THAT IS IT WHICH COMPASSETH THE WHOLE LAND OF HAVILAH  WHERE THERE IS GOLD 
12 AND THE GOLD OF THAT LAND IS GOOD  THERE IS BDELLIUM AND THE ONYX STONE 
13 AND THE NAME OF THE SECOND RIVER IS GIHON  THE SAME IS IT THAT COMPASSETH THE WHOLE LAND OF ETHIOPIA 
14 AND THE NAME OF THE THIRD RIVER IS HIDDEKEL  THAT IS IT WHICH GOETH TOWARD THE EAST OF ASSYRIA  AND THE FOURTH RIVER IS EUPHRATES 
15 AND THE LORD GOD TOOK THE MAN  AND PUT HIM INTO THE GARDEN OF EDEN TO DRESS IT AND TO KEEP IT 
16 AND THE LORD GOD COMMANDED THE MAN  SAYING  OF EVERY TREE OF THE GARDEN THOU MAYEST FREELY EAT 
17 BUT OF THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL  THOU SHALT NOT EAT OF IT  FOR IN THE DAY THAT THOU EATEST THEREOF THOU SHALT SURELY DIE 
18 AND THE LORD GOD SAID  IT IS NOT GOOD THAT THE MAN SHOULD BE ALONE  I WILL MAKE HIM AN HELP MEET FOR HIM 
19 AND OUT OF THE GROUND THE LORD GOD FORMED EVERY BEAST OF THE FIELD  AND EVERY FOWL OF THE AIR  AND BROUGHT THEM UNTO ADAM TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD CALL THEM  AND WHATSOEVER ADAM CALLED EVERY LIVING CREATURE  THAT WAS THE NAME THEREOF 
20 AND ADAM GAVE NAMES TO ALL CATTLE  AND TO THE FOWL OF THE AIR  AND TO EVERY BEAST OF THE FIELD  BUT FOR ADAM THERE WAS NOT FOUND AN HELP MEET FOR HIM 
21 AND THE LORD GOD CAUSED A DEEP SLEEP TO FALL UPON ADAM  AND HE SLEPT  AND HE TOOK ONE OF HIS RIBS  AND CLOSED UP THE FLESH INSTEAD THEREOF 
22 AND THE RIB  WHICH THE LORD GOD HAD TAKEN FROM MAN  MADE HE A WOMAN  AND BROUGHT HER UNTO THE MAN 
23 AND ADAM SAID  THIS IS NOW BONE OF MY BONES  AND FLESH OF MY FLESH  SHE SHALL BE CALLED WOMAN  BECAUSE SHE WAS TAKEN OUT OF MAN 
24 THEREFORE SHALL A MAN LEAVE HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER  AND SHALL CLEAVE UNTO HIS WIFE  AND THEY SHALL BE ONE FLESH 
25 AND THEY WERE BOTH NAKED  THE MAN AND HIS WIFE  AND WERE NOT ASHAMED
