1 AND IT CAME TO PASS  WHEN MEN BEGAN TO MULTIPLY ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH  AND DAUGHTERS WERE BORN UNTO THEM 
2 THAT THE SONS OF GOD SAW THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN THAT THEY WERE FAIR  AND THEY TOOK THEM WIVES OF ALL WHICH THEY CHOSE 
3 AND THE LORD SAID  MY SPIRIT SHALL NOT ALWAYS STRIVE WITH MAN  FOR THAT HE ALSO IS FLESH  YET HIS DAYS SHALL BE AN HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS 
4 THERE WERE GIANTS IN THE EARTH IN THOSE DAYS  AND ALSO AFTER THAT  WHEN THE SONS OF GOD CAME IN UNTO THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN  AND THEY BARE CHILDREN TO THEM  THE SAME BECAME MIGHTY MEN WHICH WERE OF OLD  MEN OF RENOWN 
5 AND GOD SAW THAT THE WICKEDNESS OF MAN WAS GREAT IN THE EARTH  AND THAT EVERY IMAGINATION OF THE THOUGHTS OF HIS HEART WAS ONLY EVIL CONTINUALLY 
6 AND IT REPENTED THE LORD THAT HE HAD MADE MAN ON THE EARTH  AND IT GRIEVED HIM AT HIS HEART 
7 AND THE LORD SAID  I WILL DESTROY MAN WHOM I HAVE CREATED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH  BOTH MAN  AND BEAST  AND THE CREEPING THING  AND THE FOWLS OF THE AIR  FOR IT REPENTETH ME THAT I HAVE MADE THEM 
8 BUT NOAH FOUND GRACE IN THE EYES OF THE LORD 
9 THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH  NOAH WAS A JUST MAN AND PERFECT IN HIS GENERATIONS  AND NOAH WALKED WITH GOD 
10 AND NOAH BEGAT THREE SONS  SHEM  HAM  AND JAPHETH 
11 THE EARTH ALSO WAS CORRUPT BEFORE GOD  AND THE EARTH WAS FILLED WITH VIOLENCE 
12 AND GOD LOOKED UPON THE EARTH  AND  BEHOLD  IT WAS CORRUPT  FOR ALL FLESH HAD CORRUPTED HIS WAY UPON THE EARTH 
13 AND GOD SAID UNTO NOAH  THE END OF ALL FLESH IS COME BEFORE ME  FOR THE EARTH IS FILLED WITH VIOLENCE THROUGH THEM  AND  BEHOLD  I WILL DESTROY THEM WITH THE EARTH 
14 MAKE THEE AN ARK OF GOPHER WOOD  ROOMS SHALT THOU MAKE IN THE ARK  AND SHALT PITCH IT WITHIN AND WITHOUT WITH PITCH

16 A WINDOW SHALT THOU MAKE TO THE ARK  AND IN A CUBIT SHALT THOU FINISH IT ABOVE  AND THE DOOR OF THE ARK SHALT THOU SET IN THE SIDE THEREOF  WITH LOWER  SECOND  AND THIRD STORIES SHALT THOU MAKE IT 
17 AND  BEHOLD  I  EVEN I  DO BRING A FLOOD OF WATERS UPON THE EARTH  TO DESTROY ALL FLESH  WHEREIN IS THE BREATH OF LIFE  FROM UNDER HEAVEN  AND EVERY THING THAT IS IN THE EARTH SHALL DIE 
18 BUT WITH THEE WILL I ESTABLISH MY COVENANT  AND THOU SHALT COME INTO THE ARK  THOU  AND THY SONS  AND THY WIFE  AND THY SONS  WIVES WITH THEE 
19 AND OF EVERY LIVING THING OF ALL FLESH  TWO OF EVERY SORT SHALT THOU BRING INTO THE ARK  TO KEEP THEM ALIVE WITH THEE  THEY SHALL BE MALE AND FEMALE 
20 OF FOWLS AFTER THEIR KIND  AND OF CATTLE AFTER THEIR KIND  OF EVERY CREEPING THING OF THE EARTH AFTER HIS KIND  TWO OF EVERY SORT SHALL COME UNTO THEE  TO KEEP THEM ALIVE 
21 AND TAKE THOU UNTO THEE OF ALL FOOD THAT IS EATEN  AND THOU SHALT GATHER IT TO THEE  AND IT SHALL BE FOR FOOD FOR THEE  AND FOR THEM 
22 THUS DID NOAH  ACCORDING TO ALL THAT GOD COMMANDED HIM  SO DID HE
